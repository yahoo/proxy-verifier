/** A class to handle localizing memory for strings.

 * strings referenced as TextViews. Common strings, such as common field names,
 * are referenced as such to save space so their memory does not exist in
 * duplicate across all transactions. The storage of this space in a single
 * location is called, in this context, localizing it. This class's functions
