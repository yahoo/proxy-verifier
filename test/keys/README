This directory contains test client and server SSL certificate files containing
both the private and public keys. It also contains the CA used to sign them.

In case it is helpful in the future, these are the openssl commands and input I
provided to generate these files.

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
